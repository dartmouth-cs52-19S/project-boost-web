|  └──[android]/                 # android specifics
```

## Installation

1. If you don't have homebrew installed, install it by following the instructions linked [here](https://brew.sh/).
2. If you don't have node installed, run `brew install node`.
3. If you don't have watchman installed, run `brew install watchman`.
4. If you don't have support for `expo-cli` setup, run `npm install -g expo-cli`.
5. If you haven't downloaded an iOS Simulator, follow the installation steps [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/introduction/installation/).

## Setting Up Project

- `git clone https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-19S/project-boost-mobile`
- `cd project-boost-mobile`
- `yarn install`

## Installing for iOS

- `sudo gem install cocoapods -v 1.5.3`
- `cd ios/`
- `pod install`
- If this fails, run the following:
    - `brew install git-lfs`
    - `git lfs install`
    - `pod update`
- Open the `xcworkspace` file in Xcode (make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed).
- Use Xcode to build, install and run the project on your test device or simulator. Once it's running, the iOS app should automatically request the JS bundle from the project you're serving from Expo CLI.

## Running Dev Environment

- `cd` into root directory
- `yarn start`
- Run the project in Xcode by pressing the triangle start button.
- If you haven't followed the directions above for installing for iOS, you must do so before running the iOS Simulator. Specifically, you must run `pod install` and **you must build** the project in Xcode. After doing so, you can run the app in the iOS Simulator (with hot-reloading for changes).

## Deployment

For deploying to TestFlight, please consult the Expo docs.
